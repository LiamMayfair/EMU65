bin: The output executables go here, both for the app and for any tests and spikes.

build: This folder contains all object files, and is removed on a clean.

WILL BE REPLACED BY debug AND release, generated by Qt Creator.

doc: Any notes, like my assembly notes and configuration files, are here. I decided to create the development and production config files in here instead of in a separate config folder as they “document” the configuration.

include: All project header files. All necessary third-party header files that do not exist under /usr/local/include are also placed here.

lib: Any libs that get compiled by the project, third party or any needed in development. Prior to deployment, third party libraries get moved to /usr/local/lib where they belong, leaving the project clean enough to compile on our Linux deployment servers. I really use this to test different library versions than the standard.

src: The application and only the application’s source files.

test: All test code files. You do write tests, no?

res: Resources needed by the program different from source code: media, ROMs...
